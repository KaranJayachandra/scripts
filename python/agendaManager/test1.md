Journal:

The first day of the year did not go as expected. I did manage to spend some quality time with Vyshali in Leiden but it was not enough. I though I could get things done and also clean up with house a little. However, Baboo was not havign a good day and I had to take care of her. I think this is good practice though for all the things life can throw at me. I will endure and I will come out on top.

Calendar:

	Pushed by Nur because of STRX meetings.
- [X] General Weekly Meeting
	The GWO meeting went good for the first of this year. I might have to take up the GWO planning this year because of my noobness.

Tasks:
- [X] Create plan for the Testing Framework
	I created the plan for the unit tests and made sure that the basics are in the slides.
- [X] Integrate the Target Simulator Code into the Chain
	I finished this over after quite some time and finally the team can move away from the old version of MATLAB.

Journal:
This was quite a hectic and full packed day. I think the work is starting to get to me and there are a lot of things that need to be done in the testing framework. I didn't have any energy to run and just came back home and passes out after eating dinner.

### 2022-01-04

Calendar:
- [X] Corner Radar: Planning for Unit Tests
	This meeting was a shocker. I might have completely misunderstood the task that was assigned to me here. I don't know if Francesco and I were on the same page. Hopefully things will get clarfied tomorrow and there won't be too much repercussion.
- [X] Corner Radar: SW Core Team
	Nothing new here other than me having to work with Tobias for the ADC data store for the unifies tests.

Tasks:
- [.] Make Presentation for the 1-on-1 with Nur
	This got pushed due to lack of time.
- [X] Fix the issue with Radar Chain Build
	This took all of afternoon to debug and I found the issue to be the duplicate files for the target simulator. They were removed and everything works now. I have also added myself to the list of recepients of the automated tests so that I know if something goes wrong.
- [X] Unit Testing Class - Range FFT
	I have written the code to write the output of the FFT into a table that can be later processed but have stopped the work after the meeting with Marc.

Expenses:

Journal:
I got back to running today and was able to run for two round of 8 mins. I am however feeling odd about the work that was assigned to me and slightly overwhelmed by the load so far. It will be quite a hectic month before I go on vacation home. I think however that I will be at least proud of finishing the work done as compared to SAP. I am enjoying the possibilites of the defining the work myself and working towards it. I still need to work on other things though.

### 2022-01-05

Calendar:
- [X] Corner Radar: Testing
	I had a meeting with Francesco about the testing approach after the meeting with Marc yesterday about the work I was to do. I felt so much better after he agreed about the approach that I was already working on.
- [X] Corner Radar: Core Team Meeting
	I was happy that I was able to contribute with the PTU code and the bracket model. However I was slightly disappointed that the 3D model was not directly accepted. There could be a more complex model needed to allow for elevation movement which is not supported by the Holmarc PTU.
- [.] Getting to know more: Ozgun
	This was pushed because Anusha contracted COVID.

Tasks:
- [X] Call Mom
	Talk to her about the Loan and plans for Pongal. Seems things might get better. I hope that I can get rid of the Car Loan before the EMIs start for my Student Loan from August of this year.
- [.] Presentation for dSpace about ADC Data
	I think I hate this task and that's why I'm not finishing it.

Expenses:
- Netflix : EUR 4.00 : Luxury

Journal:
I feel so much better after clarifying my work about the Unit Testing. I feel vindicated and also happy that I didn't do anything wrong so far. I also joined an online D&D game that is played every weekend. I hope it goes well and I can get a spot. It was quite funny that I was actually scared to send a message asking to join. Seems the book I was reading about Susan Jeffers about fear really does make sense. I went running today but didn't do as much work as I wanted to. I will catch up tomorrow. I think that this is the longest I have stuck to a system for managing my life.

### 2022-01-06

Calendar:
- [.] Weekly dSpace Discussion
	This was cancelled because German team and Dongyin were on vacation.

Tasks:
- [X] Message Kanta
- [.] dSpace Presentation
	Pushed because of laziness
- [.] Feel the Fear - Chapter 4
	Pushed because of laziness
- [.] Feel the Fear - Chapter 5
	Pushed because of laziness
- [.] Remove Distraction from Phone
	Seems like I have everything already loaded and set to go on Moto G4. I think I can skip the rest for later.
- [X] Investigate Custom ROM for Moto G4 Plus
	This was a very rewarding experience. I have rooted and booted the Moto G4 Plus with Lineage OS. I want to make that my daily driver and also download some albums that can be shared across devices.
- [X] Setup Synthing
	I have this running on my Work Laptop and Moto G4 and I need to only set this up in Arch.

Expenses:
- Bombay Palace : EUR 16.00 : Food

Journal:
I feel so happy that I installed LineageOS on the MotoG4. It seems so much better in terms of speed and use. I also really enjoyed the process of working on rooting and flashing a new image which was like learning how to install the OS on a new PC. The day however was completely ruined in the evening because of.

### 2022-01-07

Calendar:
- [X] Corner Radar: ADC Samples
	Had a great meeting with Tobias and we can decide on the next steps regarding the ADC file generation and storage. My tasks are to define the scenario for which the ADC files are to be stored and confirm them with Francesco and the Core Team.

Tasks:
- [X] Check fit of 3D print
	Had to make a few adjustments due to old version of the 3D print being printed. But luckily the material was quite pliable and I was able to shape it using some pliers.
- [X] dSpace Presentation
	Somehow finished this and waiting to hear back from Massimo if things are good enough to send to dSpace. I still need to discuss the point about the comparison of the ADC data with our models.

Expenses:
- Yogurt : EUR 1.70 : Luxury
- Office 365 : EUR 12.71 : Luxury

Journal:
I was very happy with the way things are going in regards to the lab. The mount I designed also works with the R&S cage with just a few screws. This makes things really easy and I am also not a bit more confident on the 3D modelling that I did. However the print that I supplied had correction which were not reflected on the print. However usng pliers I cut out a little more plastic and voila, everything fits. I still need to work on the dSpace presentation and need to define the scenario that we are going to test for the Corner Radar unit tests.

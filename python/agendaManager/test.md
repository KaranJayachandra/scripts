## Week 50

This week was good. I was quite productive and the new text based system was great. I have also gone running five days this week which was quite good. The head seems more free because everything is recorded and I don't have to remember things. I will continue working on this and build projects that will be enriching. I have enjoyed this system and makes me focus on what is truly important. This week has gone well and I will continue this for a couple more weeks to make it concrete and I can tweak it. I should also learn how to use grep so that I can summarize spending and also automate some of the processes. Maybe some scripts to generate the outline would also be nice. Sunday was better but not as good as I wanted it to be. I have done most of the work except work on the FreeCAD model. I feel so much better this week compared to last which should be because of the runnign and the journalling. Keep it up man!

### 2021-12-13

Calendar:
- [-] Getting To Know the Team (Ozgun)
	Not available, rescheduled to 23rd of December
- [X] Corner Radar: Testing Approach
	Good meeting with most people deciding on going with a module based approach. Need to put in paper about the approach we will be taking.

	Pushed because I forgot. Made this on Wednesday instead.
- [X] Get Sound Working on Arch

Expenses:

Journal:
This is the start of a text based agenda and life managements. I will make sure that this continues because of how simple and hackable it is. I might create a distribute a command line interface to manage it though. I have been running for the last four days and it makes life so much more enjoyable. I must maintain this so that I look in a decent shape when I visit home in February. I am excited for that but I am more excited to get a nice routine going in life. At least for now I am not lacking anything so it feels so much better mentally. I am on the right track.

### 2021-12-14

Calendar:
- [X] Module Definition
	Meeting with Rene to decide how the modules are defined in the Embedded Code. This might help me decide how to design the unit tests. The meething was not very useful, the developers for the Embedded Code are mimicing the Radar Chain 1:1. In that case, we might not really have any functional blocks and I have to define the blocks myself.

Tasks:
- [X] Test different methods to interface with the TS9510C
- [X] Interface with the ATS1500C and check the MATLAB Class
- [X] Interface with the AREG100 and check the MATLAB Class
- [X] Respond to Fabricio Duardo from R&S

Expenses:
- Capucchino, Croissant, Focaccia : EUR 6.60 : Food : L
- Soup, Bread: EUR 2.15 : Food : L
- Gehakt, Scharrel Ei: EUR 4.10 : Food : L

Journal:
The day has been quite good, other than the fact that I spent a few euros more than I would have wanted for breakfast. I tested the interfaces to the new equipment in the office in the morning and confirmed the same to the R&S Team. I look forward to the afternoon and am waiting for more information from Rene and Ali. Heard back from Rene but not from Ali. It's a pain to deal with certain people but maybe I am too quick to judge. Didn;t add the journal entry last night because if how Baboo was feeling but I did have a decent day yesterday. Other than going for a run which I thought off one my way back I did everything I wanted. However, I believe that I should work a little bit more on this file in time. I also want to remember that I was feeling down about all the travelling on my way back home and make sure that I am going to put more effort into finding a house soon. I also need to do something about eating on my way back home, it is unhealthy and I need to make sure that I don't over eat just because I am feeling low.

### 2021-12-15

Calendar:
- [X] Keysight Solutions
	Have to see whether this will be of any use. Quite interesting actually, they have created an array for an anechoic chamber. It is made of 512 array elements arranged inside the chamber in a semicircular array. It is apparently a benchtop chamber which is quite impressive. I should mention this to Nur just in case she is interested.
- [X] dSpace
	Check exact definition of the ground truth and also how to extract the information. Good discussion with Alessio, he will be joining the call tomorrow and we can work on how to decide what level of configuraility needs to be provided to dSpace. I need to update Satish about the meeting so that he is prepared for the meeting as well.
- [.] Radar Technical Meeting
	Call was cancelled because of no topic.
Tasks:
- [X] Functional Blocks for Corner Radar Testing
- [X] Create a wrap class for Holmarc PTU
- [X] Install Bitwarden CLI
- [X] Setup VIM and Latex (Pandoc)
- [X] Customize Prompt and Font 
- [X] Clean Kitchen and House
- [X] Talk to Francesco about Functional Testing

Expenses:

Journal:
I set the colors on the terminal in windows and VIM is so easy on the eyes. I love it. I was looking into whether EMACS and VIM was the way to go. I have had some experience with EMACS in 2016-17 but it was quite a pain to manage. I didn't want to use such a program. EMACS expects you to live in it but VIM is simply a text editor which is what I want. After finding the right font, my personal laptop looks very good. Although I still seem to have some issues with the network. I will debug more after work. But overall things seem to be shaping up well. I want to add my configs to a git repository and setup a sym link to them later for posterity. I did most of the tasks for today, I wish I had created more scripts to work with the old PTU and new Target Simulator but I was distracted by the shiny new toy that is Linux. I also learnt some shell scrpting but need to learn how to run it automatically after starting X. It is progress and I am happy about it. I will go for my run now.

### 2021-12-16

Calendar:
- [X] Corner Radar Testing
	I have prepared some of the material but working with Francesco might help polish it further. This call put a lot on my plate, I need to work on making a lot of changes with regards to the testing for the Corner Radar. The testing plan requires test vectors to be defined for each module and they need to be stored.
- [X] 1-to-1 Karan - Nur
	I don't think there is much to discuss about because I had a short call with her already yesterday. I might have said some bad things about the code to Nur. I will make it the next time. I will also have a much better update with a lot of progress.
- [X] ADC Data Requirement
	This is the priority for today and needs to go well. Luckily Alessio has some time and will join the call. There was some confusion in regards to what was necessary from NXP and I miscommunicated with Alessio. Luckily I didn't go fully off topic and Alessio took most of the work.

Tasks:
- [X] Create a class for Flir PTU
- [X] Create a unified interface for the PTUs
- [X] Have a look at the code to interface with the old target simulator
- [.] Run tests for the Holmarc PTU in the lab
	Moving this tomorrow because I didn't manage to get to work today.
- [X] Create a basic status bar for Personal Laptop with Battery and Time Information
- [X] Install and design a simple object on FreeCAD

Expenses:

Journal:
Today has gone well. I have finished most of the work that I had wanted to do before 5. I have also made a plan for the next day so that I can work instead of think of what to do. I will go running today and this will mark my first week of running. Two more weeks to go before I can officially say that I have created a habit. It needs constant work though. I am excited to learn how to 3D print and learn how to design using CAD. I am a bit disappointed with my meeting with Nur though because I don't have much progress to share with her. I must prove myself with some good output by the end of this month. The day overall went well. This months tracker is looking good so far. I am also enjoying myself. I also came up with an idea for a simple run tracker using an Arduino Uno with a GPS module. Let me see if I can materialize something there.

### 2021-12-17

Calendar:
- [X] Pick up Jeroen's Package from HTC60

	Didn't finish checking because I didn't get time on the Anechoic Chamber today.
- [X] Check with Jeroen about old PTU Code
- [.] Create presentation with details about the unit testing
	Couldn't work on this because I was modelling on FreeCad.
- [X] Setup project document for Personal Laptop
- [X] Clean up Whatsapp after saving Media
- [X] Measure the dimensions of the Radar and PTU
- [X] Add all the documentation for the PTUs and Target Simulator

- Gehakt, Crunchy Peas : EUR 3.10 : Food : U

Journal: 
The day has started well. I mean, it is going to take some time to get used to the new system. What I am excited about is the new Windows Terminal application. It looks really good and things are working out quite well in terms of the compatability of the new system because it's just plain text files. I am also quite happy that I did not spend any money on my way to office and I want to keep it that way. Had a good conversation with Jeroen as well and I now have full access to all the documentation related to the Lab Interfaces. Man! Picking up Jeroen's package was quite a pain. I have to get to the gym if I want to maintain my body. Work was pretty good today but I still need to work on a lot of things before I can be comfortable and feel secure about my job. It makes no sense to worry but I just can't help. Each time a small change happens at work I start thinking that I am going to be fired. However, it seems like there are things that I need to work on either way mentally. Maybe because a lot depends on my paycheck these days. Childhood whooshes past quite quick. I am not sure if I can go running today but I will give it my best after reaching home. I am writing this from the train. I ran today and cleaned up the kitchen. I feel damn good but also a little angry at Baboo for not helping. It seems like she is a kid that just gives up at the slightest hint of trouble. Anyway I hope that the weekend will be good.


### 2021-12-18

Calendar:

Tasks:
- [X] Clean Kitchen
- [X] Cook Chicken
- [X] Laundry

Expenses:
- Flowers : EUR 3.99 : Luxury : U

Journal:
It was incredibly difficult to deal with Baboo today. She had a total meltdown and I almost snapped. I somehow held it through and she felt much better after lunch where we made Baboo Chicken. I still went running and kept things clean in the kitchen which I am proud of. However I didn't do anything that I wanted to today. I will work on my personal projects tomorrow. At least set up a few scripts for basic functions like increase and decrease the brightness and volume.

### 2021-12-19

Calendar:

Tasks:
- [X] Clean Kitchen
- [X] Grocery Shopping
- [X] Fold Clothes
- [.] Make the FreeCAD model
	Missed this because I didn't make a task list yesterday night :(
- [X] Take out trash

Expenses:

Journal:
Today was much better than yesterday. However I still need to work on my relationship with Luxury and also do something productive during the weekend if I have to make a difference. I also need to understand that I mental health is important and taking on too much pressure doesn't help. I will work on it and try to take it easy. It takes time to shift your mindset but I need to do it. Being reassigned didn't seem good to me on Friday and that took over my mind and I started thinking the worst before even speaking to Nur. Let's see what she has to say tomorrow.

## Week 51

This was the second week with the plain text organizer. I really enjoyed working with this and using Linux is a joy of it's own. Windows Terminal also subs in on the work laptop but nothing comes close the real deal. The week was quite good and I don't really have any complaints. I also managed to run during my Luxury to Groningen which I am extremely proud of. Next however will be a test because of the number of days I will have to be in the office. I want to make sure that I get at least three days of excercise in even though it will be the last week of the year. This will lay down a strong base on which I can build upon in 2022. The below meal plan went out the window and I need to make sure that I use the dry pulses. They keep the budget under control and that is very much needed. I also have to remember to keep spending under control in January because of the amount I will be spending in Feb during the India visit. Hope that I can make things work and I can take gifts home.

This is the meal plan:

|Day      |Dish            |
|---------|----------------|
|Monday   |Baingan Bharta  |
|Tuesday  |Palak Dal       |
|Wednesday|Black Eyed Beans|
|Thursday |Moong Bean      |
|Friday   |Railway Aloo    |
|Saturday |Luxury        |
|Sunday   |Luxury        |

### 2021-12-20

Calendar:
- [X] ADC Data Generation
	The meeting went 30 mins over schedule. I think the conversation was hijacked a bit to talk about UMR which was avoidable. However I need to make a 2-3 slider talking about the new functional testing plan for the Corner Radar. Things to keep in mind: Phase Rotator Finite Precision, Phase Noise Mask and Antenna Radiation Patterns.
- [.] Algorithm Validation Setup for FUP Project
	This was cancelled because Francesco was not available.
- [X] General Weekly Meeting
	The challenges with Distributed Radar are synchronization and processing the sparse array. This would require Zonal Processing because a large amount of ADC Data needs to be transmitted between the Radar systems due to the bistatic response. A very interesting effect is that the target moves when the signal from a second radar is processed by the first radar. If the Radar aperture size is as large as the width of the car, the resolution is around 0.1 degrees which is almost as good as a LiDAR system. Smart TRX has the capability to act in a master slave configuration. Using this in cascaded system is how Imaging Radar is created. However systems that are quite far apart, we see certain effects that are described in "Coherent Full Duplex Double Sided Two Way Ranging and Velocity Measurement" by Michael Gottinger. This meeting was quite interesting but requires quite a lot of work to understand. I need for focus on the basics and understand them well.

Tasks:
- [X] Make a presentation for the Unit Testing
	Added a few slides but I am not sure is more is needed to explain all the details.
- [.] Make a presentation about the Testing Framework
	This is pushed because the meeting was cancelled.
- [X] Check in with Nur about leave and project change
	Talked to Nur. I feel much better now that I am assigned to Corner Radar project as well. It seems much better to be part of the team instead of working alone on 6G which could also be something that I take up in the future.
- [.] Create scripts for the Volume and Brightness
	This was pushed because the FreeCAD task took too much time.
- [X] Create the FreeCAD model for the PTU Mount
	I am so happy that I learnt how to do this and made a model. I will review with Dongyu tomorrow and see if he also things that this is a good idea.

Expenses:
- Coffee : EUR 6.00 : Luxury : L

Journal:
I got distracted in the morning for an hour with Chess. I need to be more mindful when I play so that I use my time better as well as play better. Just jumping from game to game is not really useful to get better. I need to learn how to look at defeat constructively. The day went well but I still need to work on the functional testing plan which is important and needs to be finished by the end of the day. I will work a little late into the night and make sure that it is ready for tomorrow's meeting. I didn't eat very healthy today though. I ate a burrito and over ate at lunch. I should eat a little breakfast so that I eat more healthy. Yesterday's run was so easy because I had a light lunch of Dhokla. I even managed to run 6 mins straight which is the longest in quite a while. In any case, hopefully the new weeks run is okay and I don't kill myself. I am also excited for the Luxury in Groningen this weekend and look forward to three days of chilling with nothing much to think about. Anyway going for a run now and I will come back and work on the presentation afterwards.

### 2021-12-21

Calendar:
- [X] Corner Radar Test Approach - Review Proposals
	Francesco had a daughter and I missed this meeting. I wished him and hope that his daughter and wife are doing well. I have three pointst that I need to work on here. One is regarding the adding link to the ground truth, another related to the adding false positives and finally related to the Automation for the Testing to generate a PDF after every commit. I also need to decide with the module owners to decide the pass/fail criteria.
- [X] Anechoic Chamber Area New Setup Brainstorm
	I need to work with Hans on how we can incorporate the TSM, PTU and Radar into the same LAN Network. Nur has a follow up meeting on this.
Tasks:
- [.] Make presenation with dSpace information
	This was missed because of laziness :(
- [X] Check the FreeCAD model with Dongyu
	Dongyu himself was not very familiar with the 3D printing process and there didn't have much to add.
- [.] Create scripts for the Volume and Brightness
	This was missed because of laziness :(

Expenses:

Journal:
Today was the least productive day since I started this process. I need to learn from it and move on. However I did manage to write here and go for a run which was quite nice. I will make up for it tomorrrow when I go to office. I am much more active there and get things done in that environment.

### 2021-12-22

Calendar:
- [X] Corner Radar - Core Team Meeting
	New housing for CR has some issues with the the antenna elements. The gains and the pattern are quite weird. RX1 seems to have much lower gain. I need to ramp up on the testing for the CR and create a lot of test files so that we can start unit testing the signal processing chain.
- [.] Getting to Know More - Introduction to Work
	This was pushed because Ozgun wanted to reschedule. If it doesn't work the next time we will move on to someone else.

Tasks:
- [X] Measure the PTU dimensions
	Used calipers to measure the dimensions of the PTU and the Antenna.
- [X] Finalize the Corner Radar frame
- [O] Make presentation with dSpace information
	Partially worked on this. More needs to be added before sending it to dSpace.
- [.] Create scripts for Volume and Brightness
	Missed this completely because of how late I came home. Trains were completely stuck because of the frost.
- [.] Test the dSpace VESI Application
	Couldn't finish this because I couldn't figure out how to get it working. The system is also really slow which makes it even more tedious.

### 2021-12-23

Calendar:
- [X] Weekly dSpace Discussion
	This week was quite boring. I still need to figure out how to use the VESI code that Christoph had provided. Satish is off next week, so I have two weeks to make sure that everything is working.

Tasks:
- [X] Create the script for Brightness and Volume
	I created this and learnt a lot in the process. Many commands are really intersting such as 'ps' and 'grep'. Regular expressions are crazy powerful.

Expenses:

Journal:
Yesterday was the first day when I didn't journal or run. I was too tired after work and wasn't in the mood for anything but sleep. Today was almost as unproductive as yesterday but I did manage to pull myself up by the bootstraps. I am going to go run now and make sure that the streak isn't broken. It seems so nice when things are going good but as soon as things go slightly bad, I completely lose all motivation. This run was too taxing today. I should not underestimate the power of a good warmup. I will chill for the rest of the day today with some chess content.

Today was quite unproductive. I didn't do anything related to work and I need to make sure that I make up for it next week. The Lab is completely free and I can overhaul the interfaces for the lab equipment. Hopefully I don't break anything and everything works are required. I am most excited about the weekend though. Me and Baboo will be in Groningen and will have three days of chilling time before getting back to work. Transferred money home and also took care of the rent and everything. It breaks my heart everytime I empty out my account at the start of the month. I can't say for sure that have full control over my finances but I am better than how I was while working for SAP.

The first day of the trip was pretty good. I had fun walking around Groningen. It’s a very pretty city but most of it was completely empty on account of Christmas. Hopefully tomorrow it will be a bit more lively. Packing Biryani was also a great idea. We could save a lot by taking food there instead of buying. We only spent EUR 4 per person today. I also got quite some shots for editing a movie about the trip. I am excited to play around with it later. Overall I feel good that we took this break. However I hope we can reduce the cost of the trip a little bit so that my savings don’t take too much of a hit before I go to India. Next week I plan on going to the office as much as possible to use the lab before the others come to office at the start of next year. As a bonus, I even went running! Tomorrow we plan on going to the German border which is 45 mins from here.

We got back from Groningen quite early actually. Baboo had her periods and didn't want to spend too much time outside and wanted to be in the comfort of home. I couldn't blame her and I wanted to get back in decent time as well because I have to go to work tomorrow. I want to make sure that I get a good amount of work done in the lab tomorrow and have the meeting with Nur about reorganizing the lab equipment. I am looking forward to testing the code that I have written for the PTU devices in the office. I also am really happy with the progress I am making related to Linux. I was able to interface and copy the video files for the Groningen video project to the Linux laptop more easily than Windows and ffmpeg was so powerful in coverting the videos to mp4 that I wrote a quick script that converts files in a folder from one format to the other using command line arguments. I am also learning how to use pipes and now I want to get more information about the awk program. It seems super powerful and I can't wait to learn more about it's syntax. I am waiting for ffmpeg to finish processing before heading to bed. I think this would not have been possible in windows. It's late and I'm tired :(.

### 2021-12-28

Calendar:
- [X] TRX Lab Anechoic Chamber Part Next Steps
	The meeting went well. We are going to be using fixed PCs in the lab and make sure that the cables are always plugged in so that people can quickly get to work. I think it's a step in the right direction and we need to be a little bit more systematic in the way we approach code. I am also working on the automation of the test processes so that we can schedule tests to be run after every commit and every day as well.

Tasks:
- [X] Set up the Dock in the office
- [X] Create test scripts for three PTUs
	Created three test scripts with Azimuth and Elevation sweeps that I can test after lunch
- [X] Run the test scripts for the PTUs
	The test scripts have run successfully. Even the Flir Interface which I am happy about. I will test it with the chain tomorrow.
- [X] Change the glue code to use the new classes in the Radar Chain
- [X] Create scenarios for Azimuth and Elevation sweep
- [.] Create the plan for the first two weeks of January
	This was pushed because the work for the PTU took too long
- [.] Edit Groningen project until we reach Groningen
	I underestimated this and might only be able to work on it during the weekend. It seems too much time to spend after work. Or maybe I can do it on Friday when I don't go to office. For now, it's shelved. 
- [.] Read 10 pages
	Read some awk documentation but didn't manage to read 10 pages. I am really sleepy and need to get some sleep if I have to wake up tomorrow to go to office in time. At least I don't have meeting and can concentrate completely on getting the code to work.
- [X] Call Mom
- [X] Call Jigar
	Man this guy is going off the hinges, he needs to sort things out in a hurry. I don't know if I'm being judgemental or condescending or if I have a responsibility to tell it like it is.

Didn't spend on the way to work today and I am very proud of myself. I just had a meeting with Nur and she suggested that we should start using branches which I am very happy about. I just hope that SVN has good support for this. The day was quite good, I managed to get some work done in the office and came back home and went running. I think it's going to be a pain to get things done after work this week because of the travel. I just have to make sure to get my run in. It's been a good streak and I don't want to break it. I haven't taken a break unless absolutely necessary and I want to keep it that way. I saw the STRX chips today in the lab and they are impressive. I can't believe that they managed to put a whole processor as well as signal processing chips inside such a small enclosure. I think the antenna elements need to be built seperately though.

### 2021-12-29

Calendar:

Tasks:
- [ ] dSpace presentation (Two Slides)
- [.] Create the plan for the first two weeks of January
	Moving this to Friday because it can be done from home
- [X] Test the PTU Code with the Full Chain
	This is done and too way longer than I thought it would. But at least now, I can get rid of this from my head. I suspect there will be issues when other use it for more complex cases but this can be solved as and when the issues come up. I will also make sure that a README has been added for each of the devices. This took me around 4 hours and was the biggest tasks of the day.

Didn't get coffee today as well but had to get something to eat. I ate healthy though which is what I would like to do at least. I am going to work as much as possible and get back home early. Had a healthy lunch and was productive in the morning session. I had a little bit of wasted time between 9 and 10 but I think it was needed to get me going in the lab. The Holmac PTU is working and so is the Flir. I just have to test the ATS1500C now. All the test have been completed. I have done with the PTU part of the assignment. I will now work on the unit test for the Corner Radar which I think is quite a nice assignment if I can make a nice automation suite. Had a decent run and I'm planning on heading to bed soon. I need to make sure that get good sleep for the last day of work at office tomorrow.

### 2021-12-30

Calendar:
- [ ] 1-on-1 with Nur

Tasks:
- [X] Test the class for the Target Simulator
- [X] Modify code in the Radar Chain
